we took ESP32 as the brain of the computer to control the sensors, actuators and process data. (3.3V 500mA)

L298d motor driver uses H-bridge to control dc motors easily. (4.5-36V 0.6 - 1.2A max)

JGA12V motors or used to move the robot and the encoders on the motors help us calculate the rounds motor took in a given time and then we can calculate the distance travelled usin this data MOTOR(12V), Encoder(3.3 or 5V)

Battery to power the sensors, actuators and the processor/development board
Buck Converter to step up/down the volatage for various device requirements

sensors to recieve surrounding data for proper calculation and mapping (generally 3.3-5V)
